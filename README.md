Docker Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL) development environment intended
to help in developing graphical and non-graphical EFL applications. This can be
used for both local development and testing as well as in CI.

EFL has been built with all debugging symbols, other debugging packages may
need to be pulled in as needed. It also features the Sonar Scanner to work with
SonarCloud projects, for static code analysis and code coverage, which is
highly recommended!
